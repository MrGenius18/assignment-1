## Assignment 1 :: Data Analytics in `Python`

Steps => 1 :: Collecting Random User's data in the csv file : ->

1) Get the `main.py` file run.
2) It will create a `Users.csv` file and the **data of one by one user** in that file will be **added**.
3) **This process will take some time**.
4) To `de-activate` that process, click `CTRL+C` at the terminal so that the process of **collecting random users' data stop**.


## A) Sorting Method ::

Steps => 2 :: Users data have to sorting csv file into the perticular field : ->

1) Get the `sort.py` file run.
2) This will be **read** the data of the `users.csv` file and do the perticular given **field wise sorting** and **add** this data to the new `user-sorted.csv` file by creating it.
3) After completing this process, you will be able to see the particular given field wise data.
4) That is **given** data in the `user-sorted.csv` file.

`ex.`, already given field is `FirstName` so users.csv file data has to sorting into the **first name wise (A-Z order)**.

## B) Searching Method ::

Steps => 3 :: Users data have to `searching` in the csv file into the `user i'd` or `username` : ->

1) Get the `search.py` file run.
2) This will be **read** the data of the `users.csv` file.
3) We have given in the input for the `i'd` or `username`.
4) If `user data` have to `present` so, `user details` print `otherwise` Given `user not found` print.

`ex.,` input id = `4567` ==> they id's user have to `present` so **print** thet `id's details`.
